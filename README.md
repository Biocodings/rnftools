# MIShmash

MISmash is a pipeline for simulating Next-Generation Sequencing reads using existing
simulators and combining obtained sets of reads together (e.g., in order to simulate contamination).
All output files respect the {\RNF} format, therefore, any RNF-compatible evaluation tool can be used
for evaluation (e.g., LAVEnder - http://github.com/karel-brinda/lavender).

#### For MIShmash documentation, please see http://mishmash.readthedocs.org/.
